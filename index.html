    <h2>Steps to write a song</h2>
    <br>
    <div>
        <h3><u>Step one</u></h3>
        <p>I like to think about the genre and 
            who am I singing this song to, 
            who is my audience?
            </p>
        <h3><u>Step two</u></h3>
        <p>I start by composing a 
            simple melody on guitar, 
            usually the chorus of the 
            song <br> 
            just to get an idea 
            about the key, 
            BPM (Beats Per Minutes)</p>
        <h3><u>Step three</u></h3>
        <p>I move to the computer and start 
            building the beat, composing 
            the melodies, recording 
            instruments <br>
            and adding 
            electronic instruments while 
            writing the lyrics along the 
            way.</p>
        <h3><u>Step four</u></h3>
        <p>Now I have the beat 
            ready and the lyrics and <br>
            it's time to record the 
            vocals which is kind of 
            the easiest part. </p>
        <h3><u>Finally</u></h3>
        <p>After that it's time 
            for the final mixing and mastering <br>
            of the song and 
            <span class="BOOM">
            <u>BOOM!</u></span>
            WE HAVE MADE A SONG!
        </p>
