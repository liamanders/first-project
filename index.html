                    who am I singing this song to, 
                    who is my audience?</p>

                 <p class="s2">I start by composing a 
                    simple melody on guitar, 
                    usually the chorus of the 
                    song
                    just to get an idea 
                    about the key, 
                    BPM (Beats Per Minutes)</p>

                <h3><u>Step three</u></h3>
                <p class="s3">I move to my DAW (Digital Audio 
                    Workstation) and start 
                    building the beat, composing 
                    the melodies, recording 
                    instruments
                    and adding 
                    electronic instruments while 
                    writing the lyrics along the 
                    way.</p>

            <section>
                <h3><u>Step four</u></h3>
                <p class="s4">Now I have the beat 
                    ready and the lyrics and
                    it's time to record the 
                    vocals which is kind of 
                    the easiest part. </p>

                <h3><u>Finally</u></h3>
                 <p class="s5">After that it's time 
                    for the final mixing and mastering
                    of the song and 
                    <span class="BOOM">
                    <u>BOOM!</u></span>
